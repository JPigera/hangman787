# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


A description of the project: what you learned

So far I have written a programme which takes in a user input of a letter from the user. Then the code checks that it is a valid user input and then checks if it is one of the letters of a random word from a set.
